## 🔔 Overview

Enables WordPress to allow attachments to have their own permalink structure. This makes the URLs more friendly and great for SEO results should you decide to index your attachments.

You can also edit the permalink slug of an indvidual attachment which you can not do via _Quick Edit_ like other post types. Changing the attachment title does not update the permalink slug so this handy to have should you want to rename the URL for the attachment.
